I am a PostDoctoral Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR). I work on questions in political economy, environmental economics, and empirical industrial organization. 

In July 2026, I will join the University of California, Berkeley as an Assistant Professor of Economics. I received my PhD in [Sustainable Development from Columbia University](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/phd-sustainable-development) in 2025.

  Crises of the magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic may plausibly affect deep-seated attitudes of a large fraction of citizens. In particular, outcome-oriented theories imply that leaders' performance in response to such adverse events shapes people’s views about the government and about democracy. To assess these causal linkages empirically, we use a pre-registered survbey experiment covering 12 countries and 22,500 respondents during the pandemic. Our design enables us to leverage exogenous variation in evaluations of policies and leaders with an instrumental variables strategy. We find that people use information on both health and economic performance when evaluating the government. In turn, dissatisfaction with the government decreases satisfaction with how democracy works, but it does not increase support for non-democratic alternatives. The results suggests that comparatively bad government performance mainly spurs internal critiques of democracy.

This paper estimates a political equilibrium model to disentangle demand factors (voters) from supply factors (politicians) in shaping political outcomes, focusing on the recent realignment of blue-collar voters away from left-wing parties. I jointly evaluate the impact of changes in voter preferences and voter demographics (demand side) and party positions and party discipline (supply side) on voters’ partisan realignment in U.S. House elections between 2000 and 2020. To measure candidate ideological positioning, I estimate a multimodal text-and-survey model from campaign websites. To estimate voter preferences, I build a new panel of precinct-level election results (N=1.3 million), which allows me to exploit congressional districts' border discontinuities for identification. The paper ultimately identifies parties’ stronger polarization on cultural issues compared to economic issues as the main driver of voters’ partisan realignment. In contrast, shifts in voter preferences—particularly the increasing preferences of blue-collar voters for progressive economic policies—have mitigated their defection from the Democratic Party. Absent these demand-side changes, voters’ partisan realignment would have been even more pronounced. Within specific policy domains, the environment emerges as the topic where parties diverge most in economic versus cultural emphasis: Democrats frame it culturally, while Republicans focus on economic aspects. Simulations reveal that a progressive, economically focused environmental policy would gain greater blue-collar voter support than a culturally focused one.

  We argue that the Democratic Party’s evolution on economic policy helps explain partisan realignment by education. We show that less-educated Americans differentially demand “predistribution” policies (e.g., a federal jobs guarantee, higher minimum wages, protectionism, and stronger unions), while more-educated Americans differentially favor redistribution (taxes and transfers). This educational gradient in policy preferences has been largely unchanged since the 1940s. We then show the Democrats’ supply of predistribution has declined since the 1970s. We tie this decline to the rise of a self-described "New Democrat" party faction who court more educated voters and are explicitly skeptical of predistribution. Consistent with this faction’s growing influence, we document the significant growth of donations from highly educated donors, especially from out-of-district, who play an increasingly important role in Democratic (especially ``New Democrat'') primary campaigns relative to Republican primaries. In response to these within-party changes in power, less-educated Americans began to leave the Democratic Party in the 1970s, after decades of serving as the party’s base. Roughly half of the total shift can be explained by their changing views of the parties’ economic policies. We also show that in the crucial transition period of the 1970s and 1980s, New Democrat-aligned candidates draw disproportionately from more-educated voters in both survey questions and actual Congressional elections.

We study the effects of climate change and mitigation-related employment changes on U.S. politics. We combine 2000-2020 precinct-level voting information and congressional candidate positions on environmental policy with high-resolution temperature, precipitation, and census block-group  level measures of "green" and "brown" employment shares. Holding politician positions fixed within a district, we find that Democratic vote shares increase with exogenous changes in local climate and green transition employment. We embed these estimates into a model of political competition, including both direct and demand-driven effects of shocks on candidate supply of climate policy positions. Incorporating these estimates into 2022-2050 projections of climate change and green employment transition, we find that voting for the Democratic Party increases, while both parties move slightly to the right on climate policy. Under worst-case climate projections and current mitigation trajectories, our estimates indicate that the probability the House passes a carbon-pricing bill is 9 percentage points higher in 2050 than in 2020.</div>

  Most of the attention brought towards the uneven economic effects of climate change has been devoted to inequality between countries. This paper investigates how weather shocks affect income and inequality within a country. We measure the non-linear economic effects of weather shocks on the average level of income and the distribution of income in France combining French fiscal data with historical weather data from meteorological stations. Allowing for non-linear effects of weather, we are able to compute the marginal effect of weather shocks on income and inequality.
We find that days with an average temperature above 15 &deg; C start to have a detrimental effect on average income, with most significant effects located at the top of the distribution; an additional day above 30  &deg; C reduces the average household yearly income by 0.1%. This loss is equivalent to 34% of the average daily contribution to yearly income. I show that weather shocks increase within-country inequality in two distinct ways. Weather shocks increase between-areas inequality as poorer municipalities are more exposed to weather shocks than richer ones. In addition, these shocks also increase within-area inequality by hitting more hardly the lowest income deciles within each municipality. An additional day above 30  &deg; C increases the within-municipality D9/D1 inter-deciles ratio by 1.4 percentage point. 
We then use a Regional Climate Model to predict potential effects of global warming. Under business as usual scenarios, these effects would be equivalent to a yearly reduction in national income by 1 percentage point over the medium run and 2 percentage points for the last decades of the century, due to additional warm days. Finally, using Randomized Inference, we are able to assess the reliability of the results, controlling for any spurious spatial correlations.

Policymaking in the American States, 1787--2020, with [Charles Angelucci](https://sites.google.com/site/charlesangelucci/) and [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com)

The U.S. federal system is often described as a set of “laboratories of democracy,” yet the structure of policy diffusion across states and between states and the federal government is difficult to measure. We compile the universe of state statutes from 1787–2020 (2.5 million acts) together with all federal statutes, extract distinct policy adoptions (6.5 million) using large language models, and group policies into clusters. We estimate a discrete-choice model of state and federal policy cluster adoption in which each jurisdiction’s decision depends on local conditions as well as horizontal (interstate) and vertical (state-federal) diffusion dynamics. Horizontal diffusion is allowed to vary with geographic, economic, and political alignment between states. To address unobserved correlated shocks, we conduct a range of robustness analyses; in particular, our estimates remain stable under progressively stricter fixed effects, including state-pair × policy × year effects. We also exploit plausibly exogenous variation in peers’ adoption arising from cross-legislature differences in observable characteristics. Geography dominates horizontal diffusion through the mid-twentieth century, economic similarity has a positive and relatively stable effect throughout, and partisan alignment increases sharply after the 1990s but remains comparable to historical levels. Finally, federal legislative activity becomes increasingly predictive of subsequent state legislation after World War II and now exceeds that of any single state, while the predictive relationship from state legislative activity to federal legislation declines over time.

  Does bureaucratic variation in policy enforcement explain geographic disparities in development outcomes? This paper examines the role of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the key U.S. regulation governing land development in areas with aquatic resources. Focusing on the spatial variation in U.S. Army Corps district boundaries, which oversee the administration of the regulation, we find significant differences in the enforcement strictness of environmental rules. Leveraging a geographic discontinuity design and remote sensing land use data, we show that these inconsistencies have led to substantial divergences in development patterns across district borders since the late 1970s, with significant effects on housing expansion, wetland preservation, and flood risks. We evaluate the contribution of various mechanisms, such as local characteristics of district headquarters, political orientation of district head, and potential corruption, in driving these outcomes. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for policy design and environmental governance. Given Section 404's central role in regulating both economic activity and environmental conservation, our results raise important concerns about the uneven administration of federal law and its potential consequences for development and environmental outcomes.

Ownership, Advertising and Content Choice in the News Media, with [Pierre Bodéré](https://pierrebodere.github.io) and [Marguerite Obolensky](http://margueriteobolensky.github.io/)<br>

The rise in political polarization over the recent years has fostered scrutiny of the structure of the news industry’ s influence on political outcomes. How should policymakers regulate news producers when they value news diversity and large publishers shape the ideological landscape? To answer this question, we develop an empirical model of competition for readership and advertisers between news producers. We recover the topic content and ideological positions of 200 major U.S. daily newspapers using recent advances in Natural Language Processing on millions of published articles. We find that over the period 2007-2017, the median newspaper in our sample got closer to the ideology of the Democratic party. Second, we embed these topics and ideal points in a demand model for differentiated products with heterogeneous readers. Our model shows that rich readers lean democrat and consume more news about social and political questions while the elderly are more conservative and care more about local news. Using the estimated demand model and data on advertising contracts and readership, we can recover the cost of producing each type of content. Given this model of news supply, we intend to use our framework to provide recommendations on antitrust rules weighing both consumer welfare and ideological diversity.

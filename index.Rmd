I am a sixth-year PhD Candidate in [Sustainable Development at Columbia University](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/phd-sustainable-development) and a Research Fellow at the Columbia Center for Political Economy. I am interested in topics in political economy, environmental economics, and empirical industrial organization. 

I will join the University of California, Berkeley as an Assistant Professor of Economics in July 2026, following a postdoc at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.

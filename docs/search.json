Explaining Political Realignment. \n    Awarded Best Student Work - IPUMS Spatial 2023\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nThis paper addresses how to disentangle demand factors (voters) from supply factors (politicians) in shaping political outcomes, focusing on the recent realignment of blue-collar voters away from left-wing parties. I develop a multidimensional political equilibrium model to evaluate the roles of demand- and supply-side factors in the U.S. educational realignment between 2000 and 2020. On the supply side, I estimate candidate positioning using a multimodal text-and-survey model from campaign websites, finding that candidate polarization on cultural issues has been twice as large as on economic issues. On the demand side, I build a new panel of precinct-level election results and identify voter preferences from congressional district border discontinuities. Using a model of political competition where candidates balance electability against compliance with the party line, I show that House candidates’ ability to adapt their positions to their constituents has been divided by three. The paper shows that realignment is driven mainly by changes in party positioning — particularly parties’ stronger polarization on cultural than economic issues — rather than by shifts in voter preferences. Finally, I simulate support for introducing an environmental dimension, revealing that progressive environmental policies with economic measures would attract more support from less-educated voters than those focused on cultural aspects.\n\nPublications\nGovernment Performance and Democracy: Survey Experimental Evidence from 12 Countries during Covid-19. with Michael Becher, Vincent Pons et al., Forthcoming at the Journal of Politics . \n    Press: The conversation\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nCrises of the magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic may plausibly affect deep-seated attitudes of a large fraction of citizens. In particular, outcome-oriented theories imply that leaders’ performance in response to such adverse events shapes people’s views about the government and about democracy. To assess these causal linkages empirically, we use a pre-registered survbey experiment covering 12 countries and 22,500 respondents during the pandemic. Our design enables us to leverage exogenous variation in evaluations of policies and leaders with an instrumental variables strategy. We find that people use information on both health and economic performance when evaluating the government. In turn, dissatisfaction with the government decreases satisfaction with how democracy works, but it does not increase support for non-democratic alternatives. The results suggests that comparatively bad government performance mainly spurs internal critiques of democracy.\n\nOther Working Papers\n“Compensate the Losers?” Economic policy preferences and partisan realignment in the US, with Ilyana Kuziemko and Suresh Naidu., Reject and Resubmit at the Quarterly Journal of Economics . \n    Press: New York Times,\nPro Market\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nWe argue that the Democratic Party’s evolution on economic policy helps explain partisan realignment by education. We show that less-educated Americans differentially demand “predistribution” policies (e.g., a federal jobs guarantee, higher minimum wages, protectionism, and stronger unions), while more-educated Americans differentially favor redistribution (taxes and transfers). This educational gradient in policy preferences has been largely unchanged since the 1940s. We then show the Democrats’ supply of predistribution has declined since the 1970s. We tie this decline to the rise of a self-described “New Democrat” party faction who court more educated voters and are explicitly skeptical of predistribution. Consistent with this faction’s growing influence, we document the significant growth of donations from highly educated donors, especially from out-of-district, who play an increasingly important role in Democratic (especially ``New Democrat’‘) primary campaigns relative to Republican primaries. In response to these within-party changes in power, less-educated Americans began to leave the Democratic Party in the 1970s, after decades of serving as the party’s base. Roughly half of the total shift can be explained by their changing views of the parties’ economic policies. We also show that in the crucial transition period of the 1970s and 1980s, New Democrat-aligned candidates draw disproportionately from more-educated voters in both survey questions and actual Congressional elections.\n\nWeather Shocks, Income and Inequality. \n   First 2021 Joseph Stiglitz Essay Prize of the International Economic Association. \n   \n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nMost of the attention brought towards the uneven economic effects of climate change has been devoted to inequality between countries. This paper investigates how weather shocks affect income and inequality within a country. We measure the non-linear economic effects of weather shocks on the average level of income and the distribution of income in France combining French fiscal data with historical weather data from meteorological stations. Allowing for non-linear effects of weather, we are able to compute the marginal effect of weather shocks on income and inequality.\nWe find that days with an average temperature above 15 ° C start to have a detrimental effect on average income, with most significant effects located at the top of the distribution; an additional day above 30 ° C reduces the average household yearly income by 0.1%. This loss is equivalent to 34% of the average daily contribution to yearly income. I show that weather shocks increase within-country inequality in two distinct ways. Weather shocks increase between-areas inequality as poorer municipalities are more exposed to weather shocks than richer ones. In addition, these shocks also increase within-area inequality by hitting more hardly the lowest income deciles within each municipality. An additional day above 30 ° C increases the within-municipality D9/D1 inter-deciles ratio by 1.4 percentage point.\nWe then use a Regional Climate Model to predict potential effects of global warming. Under business as usual scenarios, these effects would be equivalent to a yearly reduction in national income by 1 percentage point over the medium run and 2 percentage points for the last decades of the century, due to additional warm days. Finally, using Randomized Inference, we are able to assess the reliability of the results, controlling for any spurious spatial correlations.\n\nNon-linear Impacts of Climate Change on Income and Inequality in Viet Nam, with Etienne Espagne and Ngo Duc Thanh, Revise and Resubmit at World Development. \n   Press: [The conversation]\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nThis paper measures the marginal impact of climate variability on Vietnamese households’ income. We combine survey data from the Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) database with daily climate data from the Climate Prediction Center to estimate the response function of Vietnamese households’ revenues to past climate variability. We focus on the non-linearity of the response and notably on the impacts of extremely warm days. We find that on average an additional day above 33°C is associated with a decrease of the yearly income by 1.3%. This strong effect is not specific to the agricultural sector. It is highest for the lowest deciles of the revenue distribution. Using projection scenarios under the Representation Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 and 4.5, we find an estimated impact of global warming of up to 100% of households’ revenues in 2090 in some regions (Northern region and the Red River Delta area) under RCP8.5. These strong negative impacts are also likely to be specifically concentrated on poor households and to increase revenue inequalities.\n\nWork in Progress\nClimate Politics in the United States, with Matilde Bombardini, Frederico Finan, Suresh Naidu, and Francesco Trebbi\nEnvironmental Protection and Bureaucratic Oversight: Long-Run Economic and Ecological Impacts, with Charles Taylor and David Szakonyi\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nDoes bureaucratic variation in policy enforcement explain geographic disparities in development outcomes? This paper examines the role of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the key U.S. regulation governing land development in areas with aquatic resources. Focusing on the spatial variation in U.S. Army Corps district boundaries, which oversee the administration of the regulation, we find significant differences in the enforcement strictness of environmental rules. Leveraging a geographic discontinuity design and remote sensing land use data, we show that these inconsistencies have led to substantial divergences in development patterns across district borders since the late 1970s, with significant effects on income levels, housing expansion, wetland preservation, and flood risks. We evaluate the contribution of various mechanisms, such as local characteristics of district headquarters, political orientation of district head, and potential corruption, in driving these outcomes. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for policy design and environmental governance. Given Section 404’s central role in regulating both economic activity and environmental conservation, our results raise important concerns about the uneven administration of federal law and its potential consequences for development and environmental outcomes.\n\nThe Polarization of State Legislatures? Evidence from State Statutes, with Charles Angelucci and Elliott Ash\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nThis paper analyzes the adoption and diffusion of legislation enacted by U.S. States since 1800. We use a large language model to extract and summarize the policy content of 2.5 million statutes, from which we construct measures of similarity and diffusion. We find that states with greater geographic, economic and political similarity implement more similar policies. Consistent with an important component for local preferences in state policies on social issues, the social policy preferences of state residents (but not economic policy preferences) are increasingly determinative of enacted policies. Consistent with increasing nationalization of economic policies, federal legislative texts have become increasingly influential on state legislative texts in laws about the economy. State legislatures with similar partisan compositions used to produce more alike legislation, but that similarity in legislative texts has decreased recently despite continued partisan alignment across those legislatures. Lastly, we classify all policies into 2,048 clusters and document patterns of innovation and diffusion of these policies.\n\nOwnership, Advertising and Content Choice in the News Media, with Pierre Bodéré and Marguerite Obolensky\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\nThe rise in political polarization over the recent years has fostered scrutiny of the structure of the news industry’ s influence on political outcomes. How should policymakers regulate news producers when they value news diversity and large publishers shape the ideological landscape? To answer this question, we develop an empirical model of competition for readership and advertisers between news producers. We recover the topic content and ideological positions of 200 major U.S. daily newspapers using recent advances in Natural Language Processing on millions of published articles. We find that over the period 2007-2017, the median newspaper in our sample got closer to the ideology of the Democratic party. Second, we embed these topics and ideal points in a demand model for differentiated products with heterogeneous readers. Our model shows that rich readers lean democrat and consume more news about social and political questions while the elderly are more conservative and care more about local news. Using the estimated demand model and data on advertising contracts and readership, we can recover the cost of producing each type of content. Given this model of news supply, we intend to use our framework to provide recommendations on antitrust rules weighing both consumer welfare and ideological diversity.\n\nDo Policies Change Politics?
